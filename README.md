# Unit 12 MySQL Homework: Employee Tracker

This program is intended to be used as a management assistant, allowing a business owner to quickly and efficiently sort through information pertaining to their employees and internal hierarchy. Users should be able to view, add, and update key aspects of their business' structure, including basic employee information, job titles and salaries, and department classifications, all from the command prompt! 

## Intended Usage

According to the user story that came bundled with this project, the intent of this program is to assist a business owner in managing and organizing their employees. Ideally, a user should be able to input a variety of useful, if basic, information regarding the employees, roles, and departments of their business. Most of this functionality is currently available, although all of the bonuses are unavailable at this time. 

## Features
